A supervisor wondered at first if the pilot had killed the engine inadvertently. "The first thing I said, 'Is the ignition on?'

The transponder signal was lost three minutes later. Investigators concluded that there was no evidence of bad weather, icing, fuel loss or pilot error. A sergeant raised the possibility that the aircraft could have had its satellite links hacked or hijacked, saying: "If somebody else was on the same frequencies, they could have taken over the aircraft or just knocked it out completely."

"We kind of just sat there and looked at each other, hoping that it would regain its link," the pilot testified. The Predator was unable to fly its preprogrammed emergency mission. "All of a sudden, just like a snap, everything pretty much went," the camera operator testified. "Not exactly like a black screen or so, but pretty much to that effect."
